org.civicoop.ibanaccounts
=========================

This extension adds functionality to store IBAN accounts at contact level and use them
for contribution and membership payments

This extension stores the information in custom fields but uses custom screens 
to enter the data. 

BIC field is not required and if you have the org.project60.bic extension the BIC is populated from the IBAN

See the [hooks](doc/hooks.md)
